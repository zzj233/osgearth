**iOS / static linking exception**: The LGPL requires that anything statically linked to an LGPL library (like osgEarth) also be released under the LGPL. We grant an exception to the LGPL in this case. If you statically link osgEarth with your proprietary code, you are NOT required to release your own code under the LGPL.
