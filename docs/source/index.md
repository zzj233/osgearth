# Welcome to osgEarth!

## Introduction

osgEarth is a terrain engine and geospatial SDK for OpenSceneGraph applications.

* Add geospatially accurate 3D maps to your OpenSceneGraph application
* Visualize imagery, elevation models, and vector features directly from source data
* Interoperate with open web mapping standards and legacy data formats

Geospatial technology can be difficult to deal with, so we've done our best to make it easy. With osgEarth you can

* Get a 3D map up and running quickly and easily using one simple XML file
* Use open-standards map data services like WMS, TMS, and GeoTIFF
* Work locally or over the Internet
* Incorporate new geospatial data at run-time
* Integrate with commercial data providers

## Join the osgEarth Community

Since osgEarth is a free open source SDK, the source code is available to anyone and we welcome and encourage community participation when it comes to testing, adding features, and fixing bugs.

### GitHub Repository

Use the [osgEarth GitHub repository](https://github.com/gwaldron/osgearth) to access the source, download releases, and post bug reports.

### Discussion Forum

Join the [osgEarth Discussion Forum](http://forum.osgearth.org) to interact with other users. Please read and follow these guidelines for using the forum. FOLLOWING THESE GUIDELINES will make it MUCH MORE LIKELY that someone will respond and try to help:

* Sign up for an account and use your real name. You can participate anonymously, but using your real name helps build a stronger community. Sign your posts too!
* Limit yourself to one topic per post. Asking multiple questions in one post makes it too hard to keep track of responses.
* Always include as much supporting information as possible. Post an earth file or short code snippet. Post the output to osgearth_version --caps. Post the output to gdalinfo if you are having trouble with a GeoTIFF or other data file. List everything you have tried so far.
* Be patient!

### OpenSceneGraph Mailing List

osgEarth operates on top of OpenSceneGraph (OSG), an open source 3D rendering toolkit. If you are unable to find answers to your problems on GitHub or in the osgEarth Forum, the [OSG Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/osg-users) is another place to look.

## Licensing

osgEarth is licensed under the [LGPL free open source license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html).

This means:

* You can link to the osgEarth SDK in any commercial or non-commercial application free of charge.
If you make any changes to osgEarth itself, you must make those changes available as free open source software under the LGPL license. (Typically this means contributing your changes back to the project, but it is sufficient to host them in a public GitHub clone.)
* If you redistribute the osgEarth source code in any form, you must include the associated copyright notices and license information unaltered and intact.
* iOS / static linking exception: The LGPL requires that anything statically linked to an LGPL library (like osgEarth) also be released under the LGPL. We grant an exception to the LGPL in this case. If you statically link osgEarth with your proprietary code, you are NOT required to release your own code under the LGPL.

Thatâ€™s it.
